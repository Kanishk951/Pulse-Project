# Pulse-Project
I used a combination of tools to build a website that displays my heart rate in real time

 I used a pulse sensor, an Arduino, and a Raspberry Pi to create a website that displays my
 heart rate in real time, and I used a tunneling service called "ngrok" to expose my local
 address to the internet.
